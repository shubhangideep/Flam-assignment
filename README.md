# Java DSA Assignment - LRU Cache & Custom HashMap

This repository contains two simple Java programs I made for my Android Development Assignment (Set 1).

I am still learning Java and GitHub, so please ignore if there are any mistakes ðŸ˜…

## âœ… Q1: LRU Cache

I implemented a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache using:
- HashMap
- Doubly Linked List

The idea is to keep recently used data in memory and remove the least used one when full.

### File: `MainQ1.java`

## âœ… Q2: Custom HashMap

In this one, I made my own version of a HashMap (without using Java's built-in HashMap).  
I used:
- Arrays
- Linked lists for handling collisions

### File: `MainQ2.java`

---

## ðŸ’» How to Run

1. Compile the file using:

```bash
javac MainQ1.java
javac MainQ2.java
